# ⚙️ n8n Workflows templates

Welcome to my personal collection of **n8n workflows** — built as part of my learning journey and automation experiments using the powerful, open-source automation tool [n8n](https://n8n.io/).  
This repository includes ready-to-use templates, workflow ideas, and real-world use cases to help automate repetitive tasks and streamline processes.

## 📘 About This Repository

- Practical workflow examples
- Templates using tools like WhatsApp API, Google Sheets, Calendar, HTTP, and more
- Experiments with chatbot flows, follow-up messages, and lead management
- A few notes and documentation along the way
